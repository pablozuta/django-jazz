          <h2>Image and Denotation </h2>
          <h3>Introduction To Imagemaking</h3>
          <p>To begin this course, we're going to look at imagemaking techniques. Many graphic design practices involve imagemaking, and these images often work as literal depictions. The image represents the thing itself. And we call these kind of images denotative images. For instance, let's say I make an image of an apple. It sounds simple, but how that apple is represented can say a lot to the viewer. The technique used to make the image of the apple, the aesthetics of the image, well that can say a lot about the apple itself. You can make the apple look healthy and delicious or rotten and disgusting. So how the image is made becomes very important. The designed image says something about the actual object, about what kind of apple it is. The designer is adding extra information and communicating that information to the viewer. And this can have a big effect. In this case, it might make the difference between whether you want to eat the apple or not.</p>
          <p>It gets more complicated as you begin to change that denotative or archetypal image and pair that image with other elements. And when designers do this, the apple is no longer just an apple, it can represent or suggest a different idea. We call these kind of images connotative images. For instance if we put a mortar board on the apple or a test grade by the side of it then that apple becomes about knowledge. If we put a few lines indicating the apple is falling you could read that as being about gravity. One half red. One half green. That could be about good and evil. Or a snake wrapped around the apple. Well you might read that image as being about sin or temptation.</p>
          <p>In this course, we are going to make images that are both literal and metaphorical. Images that are denotative and connotative. We are going to look at some of the formal strategies and techniques used in imagemaking. And we are going to do this with a spirit of experimentation and embracing ideas of process. And what this means is, we aren't necessarily looking to see who can draw the most perfect apple. Graphic design isn't always about perfection. Quite often it's more about making the unexpected or the original. And we're interested in everyone being able to investigate a broad range of making techniques to generate their own images and to really enjoy the process of imagemaking. So I want you to give yourself permission to make in this loose and generative way, to really enjoy the process of making. I think you'll make some images that'll be beautiful, successful, and surprising.</p>

            <h3>Denotative Imagemaking</h3>
            <p>What is denotative imagemaking? Well, it sounds quite complicated, but in fact, denotative imagemaking is the simplest kind of imagemaking. Let's say you're making an image of an object. Denotative imagemaking is when you make an image of that object, and it is exactly what the object is. Your image is an exact representation of that object. There's no other meaning attached to it. It literally is what it is.</p>
            <p>A lot of denotation is really trying to get the essence of an image. Trying to strip it down to its core communicative value, and that's a useful skill to have as a designer. When you make an image of an object, a denotative image that is, the first thing that you have to really think about is, what is the essence of that object?.It's important to understand that a single object can exist in many different states and still communicate itself.part of the designers job is to control those messages, control those visual cues that might mean other things, and make them mean the thing that you want them to. </p>
            <p>When we make a denotative image, we also have to take into account the kind of form that we're using to make that image.There is going to be times when you want a very complex image. Perhaps a very decorative image. And there are going to be other times where you want a simple and iconic image. Say it's for an identity or a brand, something that has to be read very quickly for instance. And that's why it's important as a designer to have a range of skills and a range of techniques available to you.</p>

            <h3>Techniques of Imagemaking</h3>
            <p>One of the things that I really like about graphic design, and especially image making, is that there are a number of techniques for you to investigate. It's almost limitless, and it can be really exciting, as a designer, to be able to experiment and come up with new ways of working, and new ways of making images.There are literally hundreds of ways to make an image, and these range from ways that are very time consuming and very meticulous, to ways that are very fast and easy, and experimental.</p>
            <p>Right now there's a million images online. Pretty much anything that you want is out there, and a pretty good image of almost anything. That you can imagine. So what's gonna make your images different? What's gonna make them compelling? You could spend a lot of time meticulously making an image. Or you could create a process that's much more inventive, one that's gonna generate images that perhaps aren't already out there, that nobody's seen before.</p>
            <p>I would encourage you to try making it a lot of different ways. Try different techniques and different processes. Whether that's things that are digital and on the computer, or that's things that are done by hand, or a mix of the two of them.Eventually it'll be really useful to spend some time refining some of these images, and really mastering a technique. But for now, it's much more about generation and about iteration. Trying to make a lot of things, have fun, and get some kind of energy and enthusiasm going in your image making. So with most of these image making techniques we're going to look at, we're really interested in your process, rather than creating a perfect image at the end of the day.</p>
            <p>Don't worry about your images being good or bad or very finished or not, just make something. The worst that's gonna happen is, you make an image and then you can refine it or react to it. But at least you'll be making. A good idea is to start out simple, just basic shapes, easy line drawings, simple materials in simple form.Think how you can be clever and <em> inventive and interesting </em>as an image maker, rather than just being polished and refined.</p>
            <p>Experiment with a lot of different tools for mark making. Even though these images are all line based, the tool that the line is made with has a great effect on what the image looks like and how the image feels.The quality of the line can be seen in the tool that makes the mark but also in the gesture that you're making. Think about how your arm is moving, and how your hand is moving as you make these lines that represent the object. Your lines could be very loose and organic, or on the other hand your lines could be much tighter and more graphic.</p>
